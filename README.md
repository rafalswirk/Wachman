Time tracker with pomodoro timer. It's still in development. Application will be splitted into two parts. First one is connected with TimeCamp service. It allows to track current work.

Second is always on top timer that shows current task and count down till break.

With red color it looks cool with light and dark mode. Transparent backgroud makes it non-distracting. When mose pointer is over the timer then background is switched to acrylic one. It improves read-ablility of timer.

Plans for near future:
* Integration of pomodoro timer to new main window layout
* Reading current tasks data from TimeCamp
* Setting new tasks directly from desktop app
* Charts for showing work progress for current day/month
* Reports generation
